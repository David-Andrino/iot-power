  abstract = {The The AMS1117 series of adjustable and fixed voltage regulators are designed to provide up to1A output current and to operate down to 1V input-to-output differential. The dropout voltage of the device is guaranteed maximum 1.3V, decreasing at lower load currents.  On-chip trimming adjusts the reference voltage to 1.5\%. Current limit is set to minimize the stress under overload conditions on both the regulator and power source circuitry. The AMS1117 devices are pin compatible with other three-terminal SCSI regulators and are offered in the low profile surface mount SOT-223 package, in the 8L SOIC package and in the TO-252 (DPAK) plastic package.},

Programmable calibration value, conversion times, and averaging, combined with an internal multiplier, enable direct readouts of current in amperes and power in watts. The INA226 senses current on common-mode bus voltages that can vary from 0V to 36V, independent of the supply voltage. The device operates from a single 2.7V to 5.5V supply, drawing a typical of 330{$\mu$}A of supply current. The device is specified over the operating temperature range between --40{$^\circ$}C and 125{$^\circ$}C and features up to 16 programmable addresses on the I2C-compatible interface.},

Requiring a minimum number of external components, these regulators are simple to use and include internal frequency compensation, and a fixedfrequency oscillator. The LM2596 series operates at a switching frequency of 150 kHz, thus allowing smaller sized filter components than what can be required with lower frequency switching regulators. Available in a standard 5-pin TO-220 package with several different lead bend options, and a 5-pin TO-263 surface mount package.},
