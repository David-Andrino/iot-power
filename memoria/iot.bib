  abstract = {The The AMS1117 series of adjustable and fixed voltage regulators are designed to provide up to1A output current and to operate down to 1V input-to-output differential. The dropout voltage of the device is guaranteed maximum 1.3V, decreasing at lower load currents.  On-chip trimming adjusts the reference voltage to 1.5\%. Current limit is set to minimize the stress under overload conditions on both the regulator and power source circuitry. The AMS1117 devices are pin compatible with other three-terminal SCSI regulators and are offered in the low profile surface mount SOT-223 package, in the 8L SOIC package and in the TO-252 (DPAK) plastic package.},

  abstract = {The INA226 is a current shunt and power monitor with an I2Câ„¢- or SMBUS-compatible interface. The device monitors both a shunt voltage drop and bus supply voltage. Programmable calibration value, conversion times, and averaging, combined with an internal multiplier, enable direct readouts of current in amperes and power in watts. The INA226 senses current on common-mode bus voltages that can vary from 0V to 36V, independent of the supply voltage. The device operates from a single 2.7V to 5.5V supply, drawing a typical of 330{$\mu$}A of supply current. The device is specified over the operating temperature range between --40{$^\circ$}C and 125{$^\circ$}C and features up to 16 programmable addresses on the I2C-compatible interface.},

These devices are available in fixed output voltages of 3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V, and an adjustable output version. Requiring a minimum number of external components, these regulators are simple to use and include internal frequency compensation, and a fixedfrequency oscillator. The LM2596 series operates at a switching frequency of 150 kHz, thus allowing smaller sized filter components than what can be required with lower frequency switching regulators. Available in a standard 5-pin TO-220 package with several different lead bend options, and a 5-pin TO-263 surface mount package.},
